The relationship between Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley recieves a lot of attention as does the interplay between Wilde's _Salome_ and Beardsley's illustrations of it. Scholars speculate that there are four separate caricatures of Wilde incorporated into Beardsley's illustrations. Beardsley also made a few other caricatures of Wilde. It was not, however, exactly novel to create ironic or satirical caricatures of Wilde; these exaggerated images permeated newspapers throughout the Victorian era. I want to solidify assertions that Beardsley's illustrations are caricatures of Wilde and uncover other possible caricatures that may not be entirely obvious to us at first glance. 

I will use OpenCV and Terrence Eden's code in order to create Wilde's eigenface. I will then run this against possible caricatures of Wilde in order to determine if I can match photographs to illustrations. If successful, I can apply my findings to help prove not only that Beardsley made these caricatures of Wilde but, as Susan Owens specualtes in "Aubrey Beardsley, Salome and Satire," that Beardsley used one single photograph as inspiration for his drawings. Hopefully, this use of facial detection software leads to the solidification of current arguments over Wilde caricatures and to further research into possible visual references made throughout Victorian illustration history. This could be an invaluable tool for discovering previously unconnected links between illustrators, authors, and public figures. It would also be a useful research resource if you could search a repository of illustrations for representations/caricatures of a specific person. 

I will be using Beardsley's illustrations for Salome and his extraneous caricatures of Wilde. I will also use some caricatures created by Max Beerbohm.
