# Danielle's "After Hermeneutics?" Log
## January 19, 2015 
Galloway's depictions of different mediation are persuasive but I am skeptical of his assertion that one type of mediation can take over another. He suggests, as a mode of mediation, distant reading will dominate deep reading (Hermeneutic) or deep immersion (iridescent reading) because distant reading proves more efficient. What is distant reading doing more efficiently? Mediating? Interpreting? Unveiling the truth? It does not seem that one kind of mediation can dominate another if they perform entirely different tasks: if Hermes questions the truth and Iris admires the truth then the Furies do not look for it. If we are to accept Galloway's claim, instead of interpreting a poem or proposing a problem, we must confront a system, which gives black-boxed mediation and provides information but never immerses or questions. Scholars become curators and arrangers of information, constantly transforming and deforming but never attempting to answer questions. If we forgo hermeneutic and iridescent reading, how can we classify a text as literature? If we do not interpret a text nor appreciate its aesthetic then nothing differentiates T.S. Eliot from a twitter feed. Furthermore, would it matter what kind of media we work with? If we simply scan, make diagrams, and curate information it does not seem to matter if the media we study is watched, read, or listened to. I call this type of scholarship post-media (we are no longer part of the mediation process and the physical media we work with is inconsequential). If we no longer look for hidden truths, we are also in a post-hermeneutical and post-critical state. Although Galloway claims that the middles can dominate each other, I do not think he is lamenting or endorsing the system's take over of hermeneutical and iridescent reading. Rather, he suggests that, like Aphrodite, we are lovers of the middle and within this middle we gain gain something from Hermes, Iris, and the Furies. While the middles may dominate each other, ultimately we dominate the middles.

Scholars debate whether Oscar Wilde's fairy tales should remain in the category of children's literature. With a focus on "The Nightingale and the Rose," I want to suggest that, if understood ironically, Wilde's tales are not anti-moral but rather criticize the pervasiveness of a didactic moral voice in children's literature in the Victorian era. Children, however, lack the ability to recognize irony. Through interplay between text and illustration in P.Craig Russell's version of Wilde's tale, he reveals and reifies this irony.

How does illustration work to not only reiterate texts but work to reify readers and even create alternate visual narratives? Also, what is revealed from readers' illustrated perspective?

Digital archives allow access to various illustrated versions of Wilde's fairy tales, which gives me a linear narrative of how illustrators have visually interpreted Wilde's tales since publication. By using differing forms of illustration, I want to deform (through addition of illustration) Wilde's text in order to explore the ways in which alternate narratives affect the tale. I am able to easily display these illustrations using Scalar. Scalar will also provide a platform on which readers can annotate using images rather than text. I can then contextualize the text within a community of readers/illustrators. I want to show that illustration not only shapes reader perception of a text but that arguments can be made simply through an illustration. 

My argument will be a media-rich narrative using mainly images to show the effect of illustration on Wilde's ironic tale. I chose this type of argument because I want to create visual representations and provide an alternate narrative in order to critique Wilde's tale in a way that could not be achieved through textual representation alone. I also want to use Scalar to create a collaborative, visual conversation that allows me to not only explore how the design of Wilde's book affects meaning but how designing (or illustrating) can actually form a critique of the tale.

-Scalar 

-Digital PDFs of illustrated Wilde fairy tales

-I was inspired by Ruecker's discussion of the 1518 edition of _Utopia_ and the comment about the woodcuts that frame the book and the subsequent letters that annotated this visual representation.
