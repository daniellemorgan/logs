# Danielle's "After Hermeneutics?" log
## January 19, 2015 
Galloway's depictions of different mediation are persuasive but I am skeptical of his assertion that one type of mediation can take over another. He suggests, as a mode of mediation, distant reading will dominate deep reading (Hermeneutic) or deep immersion (iridescent reading) because distant reading proves more efficient. What is distant reading doing more efficiently? Mediating? Interpreting? Unveiling the truth? It does not seem that one kind of mediation can dominate another if they perform entirely different tasks: if Hermes questions the truth and Iris admires the truth then the Furies do not look for it. If we are to accept Galloway's claim, instead of interpreting a poem or proposing a problem, we must confront a system, which gives black-boxed mediation and provides information but never immerses or questions. Scholars become curators and arrangers of information, constantly transforming and deforming but never attempting to answer questions. If we forgo hermeneutic and iridescent reading, how can we classify a text as literature? If we do not interpret a text nor appreciate its aesthetic then nothing differentiates T.S. Eliot from a twitter feed. Furthermore, would it matter what kind of media we work with? If we simply scan, make diagrams, and curate information it does not seem to matter if the media we study is watched, read, or listened to. I call this type of scholarship post-media (we are no longer part of the mediation process and the physical media we work with is inconsequential). If we no longer look for hidden truths, we are also in a post-hermeneutical and post-critical state. Although Galloway claims that the middles can dominate each other, I do not think he is lamenting or endorsing the system's take over of hermeneutical and iridescent reading. Rather, he suggests that, like Aphrodite, we are lovers of the middle and within this middle we gain gain something from Hermes, Iris, and the Furies. While the middles may dominate each other, ultimately we dominate the middles.
