#Danielle's Comments on Thought Pieces
##January 27, 2015 


Adam:
I really enjoy how it engages cultural aspects that are often thought of as passive rather than something to use for critique: games and nature. Your prototype seems to aim at rendering both active rather than passive. Looking at the active/passive nature of Nature can lend to both perspectives of nature in game studies and in Chaucer. Ooooh cross-disciplinary. Working from a specific Chaucer text (perhaps making it central to your game design) might tie the two together in a more tangible way. Are you acting as a person or are you acting as nature on a person? It seems doable but you might want to consider taking open source code from a prexisting game in order to cut down on the learning curve of actually coding a game. Games with text or textual dropdown choices for actions would allow you to integrate a dialogue between the game and the Chaucer texts. This might help the game and your essay work more symbiotically than parallel. You coud also argue with prexisting games that already portray the environment working on the agent. Some technical challenges might be learning how to create the game and eventually integrating your findings into a succinct essay. You may have to widen a focus on either the Chaucer aspect or the game studies aspect (while maintaining your game creation idea, of course). You could look at Iain Bogost's "How to do Things with Videogames" because he looks at games as critique rather than passive representations and also Anna Antropy's book which outlines a few options for building indie games. One thing you may want to think about is whether you want to your viewers to get a feeling of achievement from the game. One of the games I was thinking of is Limbo because it portrays both the kid and the surrounding nature as sillhouettes, putting them on the same level. 

Kat:
I really like the way you look at the dual narrative quality of King's piece and the different and often contrasting ways the text can be read depending on the context and your personal background. I think your argument, with its dependence on irony and the different readings that can take place, could benefit from deformation. You could use an interactive timeline which removes events from the linear context in history and you can rearrange them on a timeline. I think it might also work to talk about erasure. Erasure is very much tied to the Second World War and the Holocaust and the erasure of an entire society. The erasure of many first nations cultures in Canada seems very relevant. By erasing sections of the text or creating an interactive way for the reader to actively erase the text might illuminate this theme. The game with the triangles and squares on the course outline seems relevant here as well. Is there a way to visually show the erasure or dual narrative that takes place in the text? 

Ashley:
I like the use of one specific poem to explore a much larger question (whether one can be a libertine and religious). I also think this balance between religion and lifestyle is an issue that persists as well. I think your project could also benefit from deformation. You could replace specific words with other words in order to defamiliarize the poem in order to pinpoint exactly what is religious about the poem. You could remove or change attribution of the poem as well. For example, only revealing the author after the poem has been read or pretending the author is actually Emily Dickinson to question whether the poem could be viewed as religious by association to a different author. Instead of focusing on showing how one might be a libertine and religious at the same time using computational methods, this could simply be a product of your deformation of the text. Furthermore, you could use scalar or CommentPress in order to collaboratively explore the various religious aspects within the text. You could even allow others to deform the text in ways you may not have thought of.

Scholars debate whether Oscar Wilde's fairy tales should remain in the category of children's literature. With a focus on "The Nightingale and the Rose," I want to suggest that, if understood ironically, Wilde's tales are not anti-moral but rather criticize the pervasiveness of a didactic moral voice in children's literature in the Victorian era. Children, however, lack the ability to recognize irony. Through interplay between text and illustration in P.Craig Russell's version of Wilde's tale, he reveals and reifies this irony.

How does illustration work to not only reiterate texts but work to reify readers and even create alternate visual narratives? Also, what is revealed from readers' illustrated perspective?

Digital archives allow access to various illustrated versions of Wilde's fairy tales, which gives me a linear narrative of how illustrators have visually interpreted Wilde's tales since publication. By using differing forms of illustration, I want to deform (through addition of illustration) Wilde's text in order to explore the ways in which alternate narratives affect the tale. I am able to easily display these illustrations using Scalar. Scalar will also provide a platform on which readers can annotate using images rather than text. I can then contextualize the text within a community of readers/illustrators. I want to show that illustration not only shapes reader perception of a text but that arguments can be made simply through an illustration. 

My argument will be a media-rich narrative using mainly images to show the effect of illustration on Wilde's ironic tale. I chose this type of argument because I want to create visual representations and provide an alternate narrative in order to critique Wilde's tale in a way that could not be achieved through textual representation alone. I also want to use Scalar to create a collaborative, visual conversation that allows me to not only explore how the design of Wilde's book affects meaning but how designing (or illustrating) can actually form a critique of the tale.

-I was inspired by Ruecker's discussion of the 1518 edition of _Utopia_ and the comment about the woodcuts that frame the book and the subsequent letters that annotated this visual representation.

# After Hermeneutics?
## January 19, 2015 
Galloway's depictions of different mediation are persuasive but I am skeptical of his assertion that one type of mediation can take over another. He suggests, as a mode of mediation, distant reading will dominate deep reading (Hermeneutic) or deep immersion (iridescent reading) because distant reading proves more efficient. What is distant reading doing more efficiently? Mediating? Interpreting? Unveiling the truth? It does not seem that one kind of mediation can dominate another if they perform entirely different tasks: if Hermes questions the truth and Iris admires the truth then the Furies do not look for it. If we are to accept Galloway's claim, instead of interpreting a poem or proposing a problem, we must confront a system, which gives black-boxed mediation and provides information but never immerses or questions. Scholars become curators and arrangers of information, constantly transforming and deforming but never attempting to answer questions. If we forgo hermeneutic and iridescent reading, how can we classify a text as literature? If we do not interpret a text nor appreciate its aesthetic then nothing differentiates T.S. Eliot from a twitter feed. Furthermore, would it matter what kind of media we work with? If we simply scan, make diagrams, and curate information it does not seem to matter if the media we study is watched, read, or listened to. I call this type of scholarship post-media (we are no longer part of the mediation process and the physical media we work with is inconsequential). If we no longer look for hidden truths, we are also in a post-hermeneutical and post-critical state. Although Galloway claims that the middles can dominate each other, I do not think he is lamenting or endorsing the system's take over of hermeneutical and iridescent reading. Rather, he suggests that, like Aphrodite, we are lovers of the middle and within this middle we gain gain something from Hermes, Iris, and the Furies. While the middles may dominate each other, ultimately we dominate the middles. git
